1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client determines when a command's output is fully reached by using a message delimiter such as the end-of-file (EOF) marker. A technique that can be used to handle partial reads is using a loop to read data in chunks until the delimiter is reached.

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

We can use delimiters to detect the beginning and end of a command. For example, we used an EOF delimiter to detect the end of command. Once EOF is sent, we know that it is the end of the command and we can begin a new one.

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols retain the state of a session between a client and a server by tracking previous interactions and using stored data. Stateless protocols do not store data and each request is treated independently.

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

We would use UDP for services that prioritize speed and reduced latency over reliablilty. For example, a streaming service might use UDP because it can display the video much faster than using TCP.

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The operating system provides sockets as an interface for network communication. This allows programs to send and receive data over a network using protocols like TCP and UDP.
